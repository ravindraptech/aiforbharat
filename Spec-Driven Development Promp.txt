**Project:** AI Healthcare Compliance Copilot (Document Risk & Privacy Checker)
**Goal:** Build a simple, responsible AI assistant that reviews healthcare-related documents and flags compliance/privacy risks using only synthetic/public data.

Focus:

* Simplicity
* Accuracy
* Responsible AI
* Fast build
* Clean architecture

Avoid overengineering.

# 2. Product Name

**AI Healthcare Compliance Copilot**

---

# 3. Problem Statement

Healthcare and life-sciences teams frequently share documents (emails, SOPs, reports) that may unintentionally expose sensitive data or violate remember privacy/compliance requirements.

Manual compliance review is slow and inconsistent.

We need an AI assistant that:

* Reviews text/documents
* Detects potential compliance/privacy risks
* Suggests improvements
* Provides a compliance readiness score

This tool is for **educational and internal compliance awareness only**, not legal advice.

---

# 4. Core Objectives

Build a web-based tool that allows user to:

1. Upload or paste document text
2. AI analyzes document
3. System identifies:

   * Sensitive data exposure
   * Missing compliance safeguards
   * Risky language
4. Generate:

   * Compliance risk report
   * Suggestions
   * Compliance score
5. Display responsible AI disclaimer

Use **synthetic or public sample data only**.

# 5. Functional Requirements

## 5.1 Input Options

User must be able to:

* Paste text
* Upload .txt
* Upload .pdf (optional if time permits)

## 5.2 AI Analysis Output

Return structured output with:

### A. Sensitive Data Detection

Detect presence of:

* Person names
* Age
* Phone
* Email
* Address
* Patient/health condition references
* IDs or record numbers (synthetic)

### B. Compliance Risks

Examples:

* Patient data shared without consent mention
* Direct identifiers used
* Data sharing language unsafe
* Missing confidentiality statement

### C. Missing Safeguards

Check if document lacks:

* Consent statement
* Privacy notice
* Confidentiality statement
* Data handling note

### D. Suggestions

Provide safer alternatives:
Example:
Replace patient name with patient ID.

### E. Compliance Score

Generate simple score:
0–100

Logic example:

* Sensitive data present → −20
* No consent → −20
* No disclaimer → −15
* Safe language → +10

### F. Risk Level

Low / Medium / High

### G. Mandatory Disclaimer

Always display:
"This AI tool provides compliance awareness insights using synthetic rules and is not legal advice. Do not use with real patient data."

# 6. Non-Functional Requirements

* Simple UI
* Fast response (<5 sec)
* Clean code structure
* Modular prompts
* Easy to extend
* No real patient data storage
* Stateless processing

---

# 7. Suggested Tech Stack

## Backend

Python
FastAPI

## AI Layer

Use LLM via:

* Amazon Bedrock Nova models

## Frontend

Streamlit (preferred for speed)

## Optional

Regex-based sensitive data detection before LLM call.

---

# 8. System Architecture

User Input
→ Preprocessing
→ Sensitive data regex scan
→ LLM compliance analysis
→ Score generator
→ Structured JSON output
→ UI dashboard

Keep architecture modular.


# 09. UI Requirements

## Main Page

Title:
AI Healthcare Compliance Copilot

Sections:

1. Text input box
2. File upload
3. Analyze button

## Output Panel

Display:

* Compliance score (large)
* Risk level
* Sensitive data found
* Risks
* Suggestions
* Disclaimer (highlighted)

Use clean professional layout.

---

# 10. Evaluation Scenarios (Use Synthetic Only)

Include sample test documents:

### Test 1 (High risk)

Patient name + disease + email

### Test 2 (Medium risk)

Internal report with no consent line

### Test 3 (Low risk)

Generic anonymized SOP

System must correctly differentiate.

---

# 11. Guardrails (Critical)

Must implement:

* Do not store uploaded text
* Show synthetic data warning
* Show not-legal-advice disclaimer
* Prevent medical diagnosis output
* Prevent treatment suggestions

---

# 12. Coding Standards

* Clean modular code
* Comment important logic
* Use environment variables for API keys
* Error handling required
* Use type hints where possible
